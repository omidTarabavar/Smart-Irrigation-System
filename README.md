# Smart Irrigation System

Course: Digital Computer Systems Design

Description:
This project involved designing and synthesizing a Smart Irrigation System using FPGA technology as part of the Digital Computer Systems Design course. The system utilizes a moisture sensor to detect soil moisture levels and, based on the readings, controls a valve to regulate water flow efficiently. The integration of FPGA ensures precise, real-time control, optimizing water usage for agricultural applications.
